PiMiner
=======

Monero crypto mining with XMRig.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Preferably a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM)
- MicroSD card and reader
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit
- Raspberry Pi Imager
- Monero GUI Wallet

Download the OS and Imager here:
https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

Flash the OS to your MicroSD card using the Raspberry Pi Imager.
Choose "Use custom" in the OS options and select the 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite
image that you downloaded. Before flashing, enable SSH in the settings menu and
set a username and password. Make sure to configure wifi as well, unless you're
using an ethernet connection.

Download the Monero GUI Wallet here:
https://web.getmonero.org/downloads/#gui

Follow the instructions to set up your account and wallet. Once the application
is done synchronizing, go to the Account tab and copy your wallet address to the
clipboard. You'll be needing it later.


Installation
------------

Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH.

If you're connecting via wifi and plan on using your PiMiner at more than one
location, you may want to add an entry for each network.

    $ sudo vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

It should look something like this.

    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1
    country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>

    network={
        ssid="<Insert network SSID here>"
        psk="<Insert network password here>"
        priority=1
        id_str="home"
    }

    network={
        ssid="<Insert network SSID here>"
        psk="<Insert network password here>"
        priority=2
        id_str="garage"
    }

    network={
        ssid="<Insert network SSID here>"
        psk="<Insert network password here>"
        priority=3
        id_str="office"
    }

For the changes to take effect, rebooting your Pi will do the trick.

As for that 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code, you'll find them all here:
https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/

Install the dependencies needed to build XMRig.

    $ sudo apt update

    $ sudo apt install git build-essential cmake libuv1-dev libssl-dev libhwloc-dev -y

Clone the XMRig repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git

Create a build directory and compile xmrig.

    $ mkdir xmrig/build

    $ cd xmrig/build

    $ cmake ..

    $ make

Once the compilation is done, you're ready to start mining. Remember that wallet
address you copied to the clipboard earlier? Now is the time to paste it.

    $ ./xmrig -o pool.minexmr.com:4444 -u <Insert wallet address here>

Although the command above will get you up and running without further ado, you
may want to have a look at all the available options.

    $ ./xmrig --help

Heigh-Ho.
